In addition to providing valuable information and education, pre-release sessions also allow Project Re-Entry staff to build trust and familiarity with inmates as they attempt to reconnect with the “outside” world. Inmates begin to think beyond the prison walls, overcome their own emotional barriers, and learn how to build healthy human connections.Along with the pre-release curriculum, Project Re-Entry also provides a variety of post-release services to pre-release program graduates after their release.
